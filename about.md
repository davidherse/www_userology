User Experience refers to a person's emotions and attitudes about using a particular product, system or service. It includes the practical, experiential, affective, meaningful and valuable aspects of humanâ€“computer interaction and product ownership. 

We believe the study of UX is essential to the success of products. That's why we are developing a tool to help track, understand and share the outcomes of user tests. 

The Userology team are commited to creating a service that can help UX designers and researchers gather insights and share results to their team. Shared understanding is the path to creating awesome products.
