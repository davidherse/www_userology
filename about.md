The Userology team are committed to creating a service that can help UX designers and researchers gather insights and share results with their team. We think shared understanding is the path to creating awesome products.

As UX professionals, we started with the goal of finding better ways to track and report on the results of user tests. We wanted to spend more time testing and sharing results and less time analysis and writing reports.

Now we want to share what we've created to give you and your team the best chance of producing something incredible.
